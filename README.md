# flipper-wav-songs
songs that I have collected that sound good enough on the wav player
gonna try stream lining the process soon but if you want to make songs sound "how they are suppose to (well close to what they are suppose to)"
then go into audacity and down pitch the song by 10% and down tempo it by 11.75% <--- up for debate I'm still working on finding the "GolDeN RatIo" by ear
