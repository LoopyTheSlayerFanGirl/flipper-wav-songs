# How do i make a good sounding song for flipper?
In Audacity go to Effect -> Change Pitch... and down pitch of the song by 10% then also in Effect click Change Tempo... and down tempo by 11.75% also, if the song has some loud parts it will be nice to down it's gain to like -3.0dB. Once you complete all changes go to File -> Export -> Export as WAV and in format options choose Unsigned 8-bit PCM encoding.
Enjoy!
